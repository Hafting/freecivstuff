Purposes of hh ruleset:

1. Combine "Units see longer from mountains" from civ2civ3, with "City reach depends on its size" from sandbox. So both these rules works in the same game.
(Done)

2. Test games with extra terrain types. This requires support from the ruleset. Extra terrain types gives nicer terrains.
